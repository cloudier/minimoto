Client program adds to queue
Service program 1 takes request from queue which reduces visibility for a time
Service program 1 crashes
Request is made visible again in the queue
Service program 2 takes request from queue which reduces visibility for a time
Request is made visible again in the queue <-- set the visibility timeout high enough to avoid this
Service program 3 takes request from queue which reduces visibility for a time <-- because here, 2 service programs are transcoding the same request
Service program 2 finishes and removes request from the queue
Service program 3 finishes and tries removing request from the queue again
